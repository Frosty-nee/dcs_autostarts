# dcs_autostarts
a collection of better autostart scripts for Digital Combat Simulator

## Install
### Manual
copy the contents of the autostarts directory to `%programfiles%\Eagle Dynamics\DCS World OpenBeta\`

### OvGME
add the autostarts directory to your DCS Mods directory and it will work as normal


## Supported Aircraft
currently I only support the F-16, more will be added as I have time / motivation, the plan is to work on the F-18 next

### F-16
The F-16 autostart has been edited to remove many of the pre-start checks (since these take up a ton of time and are unnecessary in the sim).
I've also turned added turning on RWR, CMDS, and ECM (CMDS is set to prog 1, semi-auto. ECM is set to ECM Priority (mode 2))
In the future I will be adding MFD setup for AG mode, but that will require some work
